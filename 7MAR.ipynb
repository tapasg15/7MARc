    "Range:\n",

    "The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It is the simplest measure of dispersion, but it is also the least informative.

    "Standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is expressed in the same units as the original data, which makes it easier to interpret. The standard deviation tells us how much, on average, the values in a dataset deviate from the mean.\n",

The median is typically less than the mean in a positively skewed distribution.\n",

This is because the tail of the distribution extends to the right, causing the mean to be pulled towards the right.

The histogram will be taller on the right side than on the left side, indicating that there are more values on the right side of the distribution.

This is because the mean is pulled towards the right by the tail of the distribution.\n",

    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data in a dataset. They can have a large impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode are the three most common measures of central tendency. Outliers can have a large impact on all three of these measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: The mean is the most affected by outliers. A single outlier can significantly skew the mean, making it a poor representation of the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "- Median: The median is less affected by outliers than the mean. It is not affected by extreme values, so it is a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",
    "- Mode: The mode is also less affected by outliers than the mean. It is not affected by outliers at all, as it is simply the most frequent value in the dataset.\n",
    "Measures of dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread of a dataset. Outliers can also have a large impact on measures of dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. Outliers can increase the range, making it seem like the data is more spread out than it actually is.\n",
    "* Variance: The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. Outliers can increase the variance, making it seem like the data is more spread out than it actually is.\n",
    "* Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is expressed in the same units as the original data, which makes it easier to interpret. Outliers can increase the standard deviation, making it seem like the data is more spread out than it actually is.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following dataset of exam scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "{85, 92, 78, 95, 88, 77, 93, 89, 91, 150}\n",
    "This dataset contains an outlier, 150, which is much higher than the other exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean of the dataset is 88.11. However, the mean is significantly affected by the outlier, 150. A more representative measure of central tendency would be the median, which is 89.\n",
    "Median: The median of the dataset is 89. The median is not affected by the outlier, 150, so it is a more representative measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",
    "Mode: The mode of the dataset is 91. The mode is also not affected by the outlier, 150, so it is a more representative measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",
    "Range: The range of the dataset is 73. However, the range is significantly affected by the outlier, 150. A more representative measure of dispersion would be the interquartile range (IQR), which is 13.75.\n",
    "Variance: The variance of the dataset is 171.34. However, the variance is significantly affected by the outlier, 150. A more representative measure of dispersion would be the median absolute deviation (MAD), which is 6.75.\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation of the dataset is 13.08. However, the standard deviation is significantly affected by the outlier, 150. A more representative measure of dispersion would be the robust standard deviation, which is 9.68."
